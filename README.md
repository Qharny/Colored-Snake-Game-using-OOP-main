 # Snake Colored

This is a simple snake game written in C++. The game is controlled by the arrow keys. The objective of the game is to eat as many fruits as possible without hitting the walls or your own body.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

The code is divided into two main parts: the header file and the source file. The header file contains the declarations of the classes and functions used in the game. The source file contains the implementations of the classes and functions.

### The Header File

The header file contains the following declarations:

* The `Point` class represents a point on the screen.
* The `Snake` class represents the snake.
* The `main` function.

### The Source File

The source file contains the implementations of the classes and functions declared in the header file.

The `Point` class has the following methods:

* `SetPoint(int x, int y)`: Sets the point's coordinates.
* `GetX()`: Gets the point's x-coordinate.
* `GetY()`: Gets the point's y-coordinate.
* `MoveUp()`: Moves the point up by one unit.
* `MoveDown()`: Moves the point down by one unit.
* `MoveLeft()`: Moves the point left by one unit.
* `MoveRight()`: Moves the point right by one unit.
* `Draw(char ch='O')`: Draws the point on the screen.
* `Erase()`: Erases the point from the screen.
* `CopyPos(Point * p)`: Copies the point's coordinates to the specified point.
* `IsEqual(Point * p)`: Returns 1 if the point is equal to the specified point, otherwise returns 0.
* `Debug()`: Prints the point's coordinates to the console.

The `Snake` class has the following methods:

* `AddCell(int x, int y)`: Adds a new cell to the snake at the specified coordinates.
* `TurnUp()`: Turns the snake up.
* `TurnDown()`: Turns the snake down.
* `TurnLeft()`: Turns the snake left.
* `TurnRight()`: Turns the snake right.
* `WelcomeScreen()`: Displays the welcome screen.
* `Move()`: Moves the snake.
* `SelfCollision()`: Returns 1 if the snake has collided with
